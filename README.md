# At a Glance
Extremely basic Glance widget project. Creates a basic widget with compose (with some good advice, for free)

# Summary
Creating a really basic widget with compose and Glance, I learned how to handle user interaction as well (adding a button to launch an activity as an example). Unfortunately, using the `.clickable` modifier didn't work to do that here, hopefully in future updates of the library it will.
